# Project 1: [My roadmap to data analytics certificate](https://github.com/sk97ap/Sarah/blob/main/dailyactivity.utf8.pdf)
             I created a case study on device fitness data.
             The data was cleaned, analysed and visualized using R. 
             The focus was on the Bellabeat leaf crystal product. 
             Finding new insights might help guide Bellabeat marketing strategy.
